    description: "The original Audi A5 was introduced as a stylish coupe based on the B8 A4 platform. Designed by Walter de Silva, who called it his 'most beautiful creation,' the A5 featured elegant proportions with a flowing roofline. The range expanded to include the five-door Sportback and Cabriolet variants. Engine options mirrored the A4 lineup with four and six-cylinder petrol and diesel options, while the S5 featured a 4.2L V8 (later a supercharged V6) and the RS5 offered a high-revving 4.2L V8 producing 450 HP. A facelift in 2012 brought revised styling and updated technology."

Engine options include efficient four and six-cylinder TFSI petrol and TDI diesel units, with the S5 featuring a turbocharged V6 and the RS5 powered by a twin-turbo V6 producing 450 HP. A facelift in 2019 refreshed the exterior design and updated the interior technology. The A5 continues to represent the perfect balance between elegance and sportiness in Audi's lineup."
